This version is built with Go 1.21.1 which contains some relevant security fixes for the html/template package, see Issue 62196 and Issue 62197. This is the main reason Hugo 0.119.0 is released sooner rather than later. But this release also comes with a dependency refresh and some useful image processing improvements:
A new general-purpose Process method and filter. A new Opacity filter.

It‚Äôs official, the final stable release of v5.3.0 has landed! It‚Äôs been a monumental effort to revamp our codebase for CSS variables and color modes, one that will see continued changes leading up to an eventual Bootstrap 6. And we‚Äôre so excited to finally ship it!
On top of all the work that‚Äôs gone into this release, a lot has happened behind the scenes since we shipped our pre-releases.</description></item><item><title>Hugo v0.100.2</title><link>https://mydomain.christmas/post/hugo-v0-100/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mydomain.christmas/post/hugo-v0-100/</guid><description>{ .img-fluid .mb-5 }
This release is mostly motivated by the fix for the panic experienced by people having blackfriday configured as defaultMarkdownHandler (#9968). The Blackfriday support was removed in Hugo v0.100.0 after being deprecated with a warning for a long time.
v0.100.1 fix panic with markdownify/RenderString with shortcode on Page with no content file.
$page.RenderString (see #6703) finally supports shortcodes, and shortcode improvements is the main theme in Hugo 0.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Bootstrap Theme alpha</title><link>https://mydomain.christmas/post/hugo-bootstrap-theme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 13:35:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mydomain.christmas/post/hugo-bootstrap-theme/</guid><description>Hugo theme for a secure, blazing fast and SEO-ready static website, using Bootstrap 5.
